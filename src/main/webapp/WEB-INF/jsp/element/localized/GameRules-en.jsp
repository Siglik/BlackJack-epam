		<strong>Button Descriptions</strong>
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Deal - Used to start the game after you have placed your bet.</li>
		<li>Hit - Used when you want to be dealt another card. Players
			can hit as many times as they like unless the total of the cards
			equals or exceeds 21.</li>
		<li>Stay - Used when you want to keep the hand dealt to you. This
			automatically happens if you hit 21 or double down.</li>
		<li>Double - After being dealt the first two cards a Player can
			decide to double down. The bet on the hand is doubled and one
			additional card is dealt to the Player.</li>
		<li>Split - Used to split the first two cards dealt into two
			separate hands when they match. You can have up to four hands at one
			time. Then, one additional card will be dealt for each hand.</li>
		<li>Surrender - If a Player decides to surrender, they get 50% of
			the bet and the other half goes to the house.</li>
		<li>Insurance - If the Dealer is showing an ace, the Player is
			offered a supplemental bet called insurance. A wager of exactly half
			of the original bet is placed on the table. If the Dealer has
			Blackjack, the house pays the Insurance bet 2 to 1. If the Dealer
			does not have Blackjack, the Player loses the insurance bet, and the
			Player's initial bet is then settled by comparing his cards with the
			Dealer's. If the Dealer and the Player both have Blackjack, the game
			is pushed and the Player gets the amount won by taking insurance,
			called even money.<br> &nbsp;
